# Cryptography-assignment
In first code, cipher with fixed key i tried to encode a text file using the defined key.
in the "Cipher" file, a text is recieved as plaintext and user can choose encryption or decryption mode.
in analysis file i tried to count the number of letters in a “normal text”, and find out which letters are met more often, that would help us to break the cipher.
