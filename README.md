# Cryptography-assignment
In the first code, a cypher with a fixed key I tried to encode a text file using the defined key.
in the "Cipher" file, a text is received as plaintext and the user can choose encryption or decryption mode.
in the analysis file, I tried to count the number of letters in a “normal text”, and find out which letters are met more often, which would help us to break the cypher.
the result of encrypting two texts is saved in two files that are uploaded.
